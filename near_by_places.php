                                        Located in the southwest of Sri Lanka, Hikkaduwa is a seaside tourist community.
                                        It is also renowned for its powerful surf and beaches, such as the palm-lined Hikkaduwa Beach, which is surrounded by eateries and bars.
                                        The Hikkaduwa National Park, which is a coral sanctuary and home to sea turtles and unusual species, is protected by the shallow waters opposite Hikkaduwa Beach. 
                                        Gangarama Maha Vihara, located inland, is a Buddhist temple featuring hand-painted paintings.

                                        West-coast Hikkaduwa is famous for its <b>long sandy beach</b>, but it also has <b>good waves for surfers, reefs for snorkelers and divers, and sand-side hotels, restaurants, and pubs</b>. 
                                        Add an island temple, tsunami museum, and turtle sanctuary, and you've got one of Sri Lanka's top beach vacation spots.

                                        There are often a few turtles grazing on the seaweed near the coast on the turtle beach in Hikkaduwa. 
                                        <b>You can easily go very near to the turtles because they are in rather shallow water.</b>

                                        <b>Sea Turtle Hatchery</b>, If you're in Hikkaduwa, the sea turtle hatchery is a lovely spot to visit. If you love animals, seeing the turtles in person is a great experience.
                                        The large sea turtles of Sri Lanka are on the endangered species list, and the Turtle Hatchery's objective is to change that.
                                        It purchases sea turtle eggs that would otherwise be consumed by locals and breeds them in a safe nesting area. Aside from breeding, it also functions as a rehabilitation center for injured sea turtles.

                                        Unawatuna, which is in the southern region of Sri Lanka, is an AMAZING destination to visit.
                                        The major stretch of beach in Unawatuna, Unawatuna beach, is surrounded with fantastic places to eat, chill, and swim.
                                        Although it's a popular beach with tourists, it's a nice area to relax throughout the day, swim, or just have dinner.
                                        When the weather is ideal, one of the best things to do at Unawatuna beach is to walk the length of the entire beach shortly before sunset before choosing a wonderful location to eat for sunset.
                                        You'll need about 15-20 minutes to complete the walk.

                                        <b>A swing at Dalawella Beach</b> There are other instances where social media has caused something to go viral, but none is as well-known as the Dalawella beach swing in Sri Lanka! Swinging from a palm tree over the Indian Ocean could be the most enjoyable and photogenic activity there is. Nothing, to be precise.

                                        Snorkeling is feasible in many places in Sri Lanka, and the main snorkeling location in Unawatuna is <b>Jungle Beach</b>.
                                        It is a little cove surrounded by jungle in Rumassala, northwest of Unawatuna, where you can spend the day sunbathing also. Anyone with snorkeling equipment can go out and enjoy life on the reef.

                                        Within the Galle Fort complex, the <b>Galle Lighthouse</b> is a breathtaking site to see. Essentially, it's gorgeous because it appears to be out of place.
                                        It all feels extremely European, which contrasts nicely with the Sri Lankan characteristics that surround it. Galle lighthouse is ideal for taking photos, relaxing with an ice cream, or simply admiring the vista behind it.

                                        <b>Japanese Peace Pagoda</b> Reviews claim that the scenery is stunning and the photos are excellent. The Mahayana sect of Japanese Buddhist monks constructed this spectacular pagoda in 2005 on a mountainside west of Unawatuna as part of their plan to construct peace temples in conflict areas (back in the Sri Lankan wartime).
                                        It is a steep 20-minute trek from Unawatuna beach's western end. Keep in mind to dress conservatively, or at the very least, bring a sarong to cover yourself.

                                        It offers the visitor a chance to see Sri Lanka's varied fauna.

                                        One of the oldest Buddhist monasteries is the <b>Sithulpawwa Buddhist Monastery</b>. From the monastery, you have the most amazing panoramic view. It is a site of worship of historical archeological value that dates back many centuries.
                                        Being able to witness <b>elephants and other wild animals</b> on the way to this location adds excitement to the journey itself.

                                        Buddhists must visit the historic <b>Tissamaharama Raja Maha Vihara temple</b> in Tissamaharama, which is close to Kataragama in Sri Lanka's Southern Province. 
                                        It is constantly crowded with visitors because it is one of Sri Lanka's four remaining old Buddhist monasteries. 
                                        This location is thought to have been constructed during the time Arhant Mahinda Thera came. 
                                        Its significance can therefore best be assessed by the fact that <b>Tissamaharama Raja Maha Vihara was blessed by Lord Buddha during his third visit to Sri Lanka</b>.

                                        A beautiful beach and a Buddhist shrine perched on rocks may be seen in this village.

                                        Sigiriya, also known as <b>Lion Rock or Lion Mountain</b>, is a historical location in central Sri Lanka that is home to the remains of a former fortress that was constructed on a spectacular monolithic rock pillar in the late 5th century CE. 
                                        <b>The rock rises to a height of 1,144 feet (349 meters) above sea level and is roughly 600 feet (180 meters)</b> above the nearby plain because of how steeply it is angled.

                                        On the numerous acres of land at the summit, the Sinhalese king Kashyapa I (477–495) constructed a palace in the form of a massive lion with the intention of defending himself from his adversaries. 
                                        The palace, however, fell into disrepair after the king was overthrown in 495. 
                                        But the location quickly became a favorite destination for travelers, and it is now a well-liked tourist attraction. 
                                        One of the few still-standing sections of the palace, the last trek to the top is started by visitors through the open paws of the lion. 
                                        <b>21 Apsara paintings</b> found on rocks are also noteworthy (celestial singers and dancers). 
                                        In 1982, <b>Sigiriya received the UNESCO designation of World Heritage Site.</b>
